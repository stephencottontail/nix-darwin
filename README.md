# `nix-darwin` Configuration

Here's my configuration for managing my Macs through Nix. Enjoy.

Some usage notes:

  * [Nix](https://github.com/DeterminateSysmtes/nix-installer) needs to be installed manually, using the command line so we get upstream Nix
  * [MacFUSE](https://macfuse.github.io/) can't be installed through Nix, so we need to install it manually as well. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) would be another option, but I prefer to stick with just one package manager.
